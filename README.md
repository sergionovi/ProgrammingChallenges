# ProgrammingChallenges

I am updating here Python codes that I did when I was starting to learn Python (Back in 2018). 
Most of the codes were performed to solve problems from CodeSignal and HackerRank. 
Even though theses exercises were not meant to solve real-world problems, they did help me to get in touch with Python.
